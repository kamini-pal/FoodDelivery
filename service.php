                    <p>Understanding these 5 different types of service, their individual benefits and challenges helps decide which one to use for your restaurant.</p>
                    <h3>1. Waiter service</h3>
                    <p>More commonly known as sit-down service, a waiter takes care of everything from taking orders to serving food and payment.</p>
                    <p><b>Benefits</b></p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>1. Service is more personalised as diners are served directly.</li>
                    <li>2. Special requests can be more easily accommodated compared to other services.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p><b>Challenges</b></p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>1. Requires skilled service staff because the waiter has to remember orders, service protocols and serve promptly.</li>
                    <li>2. More prone to mistakes as miscommunication with the kitchen can lead to wrong orders being served to guests.<br>
                    &nbsp;</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>2. Chinese banquet service</h3>
                    <p>Another form of waiter service where each waiter takes care of a table or group of tables with 10-12 guests. Dishes are usually communal and shared.<br>
                    </p>
                    <p><b>Benefits</b></p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>1. Guests feel more relaxed because of the communal sharing dishes.</li>
                    <li>2. Food served is usually pre-ordered so the waiters don’t have to worry about taking orders.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><b>Challenges</b></p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>1. Requires a big number of skilled staff because different tables have to be served at the same time.<br>
                    </li>
                    <li>1. Coordination with the kitchen is key as all the food has to be served fresh at the same time.<br>
                    </li>
                    </ul>
